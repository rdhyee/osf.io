    Comments on public nodes are given read-only access to everyone. Comments on private nodes are only visible
    to contributors and administrators on the parent node. Only the user who created the comment has permission
    to edit and delete the comment.

    Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used, the user relationship will not be exposed.

    ##Attributes

    OSF comment entities have the "comments" `type`.

    ##Relationships

    ###User

    ###Node

    The project associated with this comment.

    ###Target

    The "parent" of the comment. If the comment was made on a node, the target is the node. If the comment
    is a reply, its target is the comment it was in reply to.

    ###Replies
    List of replies to this comment. New replies can be created through this endpoint.

    ###Reports

    To update a comment, issue either a PUT or a PATCH request against the `/links/self` URL.  The `content`
    and `deleted` fields are mandatory if you PUT and optional if you PATCH. Non-string values will be accepted and
    stringified, but we make no promises about the stringification output.  So don't do that.

    To restore a deleted comment, issue a PATCH request against the `/links/self` URL, with `deleted: False`.

    To delete a comment send a DELETE request to the `/links/self` URL.  Nothing will be returned in the response
