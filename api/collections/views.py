    mandatory. All other fields not listed above will be ignored.  If the Organizer Collection creation is successful
    the API will return a 201 response with the representation of the new node in the body.
    For the new Collection's canonical URL, see the `/links/self` field of the response.

    + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search results on.

    Organizer Collections may be filtered by their `title`, which is a string field and will be filtered using simple

    To update an Organizer Collection, issue either a PUT or a PATCH request against the `/links/self` URL.
    The `title` field is mandatory if you PUT and optional if you PATCH, though there's no reason to PATCH if you aren't
    changing the name. Non-string values will be accepted and stringified, but we make no promises about the
    stringification output.  So don't do that.

    <!--- Copied Spiel from NodeDetail -->

    On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The difference between a project and a component
    is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of the project. There is also a [category
    field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option. The categorization essentially determines
    which icon is displayed by the node in the front-end UI and helps with search organization. Top-level nodes may have
    a category other than project, and children nodes may have a category of project.

    `description`, and `category` are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching.  `public` and
    `registration` are booleans, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`.  Note
    that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail regardless.  `tags` is an array of simple strings.

    This requires both edit permission on the collection, and for the user that is
    making the request to be able to read the nodes requested. Data can be contain any number of
    node identifiers. This will replace the contents of the node_links for this collection with
    the contents of the request. It will delete all node links that don't have a node_id in the data
    array, create node links for the node_ids that don't currently have a node id, and do nothing
    for node_ids that already have a corresponding node_link. This means a update request with
    {"data": []} will remove all node_links in this collection
