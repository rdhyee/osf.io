Hello ${user.fullname},

We just wanted to let you know that ${initiated_by} has initiated an embargoed registration for the following pending registration: ${registration_link}${context.get('custom_message', '')}.

If approved, a registration will be created for the project, viewable here: ${registration_link}, and it will remain
private until it is withdrawn, manually made public, or the embargo end date has passed on ${embargo_end_date.date()}.

Sincerely yours,

The OSF Robots
