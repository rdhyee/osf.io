    <p>Registration creates a frozen, time stamped version of a project that cannot be edited or deleted (but can be withdrawn). You can register your project by navigating to the Registrations tab and selecting a registration form, entering information about your project, and confirming your registration. For the registration, files stored in external storage add-ons like Dropbox and figshare will be copied to OSF Storage by our service called <b>OSF Archiver</b>. By archiving this content for a registration, its persistence is ensured. The registration will have its own unique, persistent URL that is always linked back to the project.</p>

    <p>You will be able to continue editing the original project; however, the registration will be frozen, timestamped, and uneditable. Registrations cannot be deleted; however, they can be withdrawn. Withdrawing a registration will leave behind metadata about when the registration was created and withdrawn but removes the contents of the registration.</p>

    <p>A registration can be made public immediately or entered into an embargo period of up to 4 years. At the end of the embargo period, the registration will automatically become public.</p>
