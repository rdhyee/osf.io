    <h4 class="m-t-lg f-w-lg">Files</h4>
    <p>Each project and component can have its own set of files. This allows you to organize your files into meaningful
        groups like datasets or background research.</p>
    <p>Each file is also given a unique, persistent URL, meaning that it can be cited or linked to individually.</p>
    <p id="version-control">To upload a file, click on "Files" in the grey navigation bar under the Project/Component's title.
        Drag the file from your desktop onto the screen to upload, or select a storage add-on in the files pane and click the upload
        button in the toolbar.</p>
    <p>Click on a file's name to view it. From this page, you can also:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the &ldquo;Share&rdquo; button to link to your file or embed it on your blog or website.</li>
      <li>
        &ldquo;Check out&rdquo; the file to prevent collaborators from making changes to the file while you're working on it
        (must have &ldquo;Write&rdquo; or &ldquo;Admin&rdquo; privileges).
      </li>
        <li>Tag your file to enhance discoverability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>OSF Storage, the default storage add-on for every project, supports version control.
        You can create new versions of a file by re-uploading the latest copy&mdash;no need to change the name.
        To view or download old versions, first click on the file's name. Then click on the &ldquo;Revisions&rdquo; button on the top right
        of the page when viewing the file (the File Detail page).</p>
      <p>To download a file, select the file and click the &ldquo;Download&rdquo; button that appears in the toolbar. To delete a file,
        select the file and click the Delete button. You can create folders by selecting the appropriate
        storage add-on and clicking the &ldquo;Create Folder&rdquo; button in the toolbar.</p>
    <p>Only contributors of that component with writing privileges can add or delete a file. If a component is set to
        be private, then no one will be able to see the enclosed files, but public components and projects allow
        anyone to download their materials.</p>
